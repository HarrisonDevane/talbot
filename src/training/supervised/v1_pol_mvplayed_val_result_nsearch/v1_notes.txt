Talbot V1

- Trained on lichess data, input = 18x8x8 tensor. Output = move played, end result
- Plateau after ~7 epochs.
- Inference was surprisingly good! Great proof of concept

Potential future ideas:
- change val head to stockfish eval for more precision
- Include search feature
- More res blocks in model
- Add historical positions to input
